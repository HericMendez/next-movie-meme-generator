## Next Movie Meme Generator

This is a remake of the original project["filminho generator"](https://hericmendez.github.io/filminho-generator/) that i made a few years ago, using HTML+CSS+JS. This application is being made with NextJS and the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Development
Clone the repository in your machine:


```bash
git clone git@github.com:HericMendez/next-movie-meme-generator.git
```  
And run:
```bash
npm install
#then
npm run dev
```  

Of course, you'll have to add your own TMDB API Key.  
You can find out how to get one in the [TMDB API Documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
